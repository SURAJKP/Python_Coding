## Description

This project serves as a personal collection of Python exercises, small projects, and code snippets. The main goals are:
*   Solidify understanding of core Python concepts (loops, functions, classes, etc.).
*   Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code following [PEP 8 guidelines](www.python.org) and other best practices.
*   Explore specific libraries and frameworks as needed (e.g., `pandas`, `requests`, `pytest`).

Feel free to explore the different folders, each focusing on a specific topic or project.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** Version 3.10+ (specify the exact version you are using).
*   **Git:** Version control.
*   **VS Code:** (Optional: Mention your preferred IDE/editor).
*   **`pytest`:** For testing purposes.

## Setup and Installation

To run the practice files locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone github.com
    cd python-coding-practice
    ```

2.  **Ensure Python is installed:**
    Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can check with:
    ```bash
    python --version
    # or
    python3 --version 
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies** (if any are required for specific projects):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions for the exercises within. Generally, you can run a Python script from your terminal:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

You can step through code using a debugger or run tests using `pytest` within the activated virtual environment.

## Contributing

This is a personal practice repository, but suggestions for improvements or alternative solutions are welcome.

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.
